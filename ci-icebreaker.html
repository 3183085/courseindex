                Our task for this extra assignment was to watch Objectified, a documentary from 2009. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We were to review the film and describe one thing we agreed with and one thing you disagree with. In a few paragraphs, we had to describe our own design philosophy and methodology. The following questions were provided to assist us in finding an answer: What do you value? How do you work? Why does what you do have meaning? 
                <br>
                <br>
                The final task was to describe why we choose graphic design?<br> 
                The following questions were provided to assist us in finding an answer: Think of a time that design moved you. What did you feel?

                1) Around the 31:40 mark, the speaker mentions how "things will be marketed in terms of design, in the future." I can relay this sentiment as there have been some instances of an object's creative design outweighing the utility of the item itself. One notable instance being the trend of "hypebeast" apparel that cost a lot of money despite the simple design and low manufacturing cost. The visual appeal of an object or the brand it's attached to is slowly becoming more important than the contents of the item itself. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of something that I disagree with, there wasn't really much said in the documentary that I couldn't relate to at least somewhat. I guess in the statement regarding newer products and how "[their] form bears absolutely no relation to the function" could be argued with. As a generation gets more accustomed to the the tech of their day and age, they also gain an understanding of how said tech operates. The function of which an item is meant to fulfill becomes more widespread to consumers, developers and designers alike, so they slowly begin reworking that function into a new design that allows for more things to be included alongside what already exists. So I feel like that form of a object does still hold some relation to its function. but to a much lesser extent.

                <br>
                <br>

                2) When it comes to my design philosophy, I unintentionally tend to hold style over substance. I like when the works I create have a uniqueness to them that relay back to me. So to achieve that, I like emphasizing the use of certain colours or forms in a piece to create a reoccurring theme, or having the the foreground consist of smaller texts akin to some word art. I like expressing a specific mood through the use a shapes, text and colours in a unconventional way. 

                <br>
                <br>
                
                3) I wasn't initially that interested in pursuing design work as a possible career path. I originally planned in studying in a field that more so focuses on digital illustrations and two-dimensional animation. However, after partaking in several design classes and extracurricular actives, I've grown fond of the design process and the techniques many creators use to exude internal meaning within their works. I ended up continuing in graphic design because I simply liked the process of mashing different styles of work together and forming something new out of them.
