                This assignment asked us to think critically about embodiment and our own embodied interactions with the digital tools around us and the environments that populate our  daily lives. We were to engage in auto-ethnographic research by observing and documenting their firsthand experience of a particular digital interaction. The definition of “digital interaction” in this assignment was intentionally broad and ranges in complexity from scrolling through an Instagram feed to playing ones favourite online game, to something as simple as setting the digital clock on your microwave.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first part was to observe ourselves and to record how we feel our way through the navigation of various digital tools and/or environments. Documenting one's user Of course, none of this really matters in a design/development context unless we can take those personal, embodied interactions and effectively communicate them to a broader public. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The second part asked us to design an infographic that visualizes at least one kind of quantitative information and one kind of qualitative information about our experience in a single, unified compositional space, whether that be 2D, 3D or 4D.

                How many games did I play?<br>
                Over the course of the last week, I played 3 mobile games.
                <br>
                <br>
                What games did I play?<br>
                The games I played were Dragalia Lost, Fire Emblem Heroes and Pokémon Masters EX.
                <br>
                <br>
                How long did I play each game for?<br>
                During that week, I played Dragalia for a total of 185 minutes, Fire Emblem Heroes for 271 minutes, and Pokémon Masters EX for 107 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                How many times did I play each game?<br>
                During that week, I opened Dragalia for a total of 78 times, Fire Emblem Heroes for 123 times, and Pokémon Masters EX for 19 times.
                <br>
                <br>
                Where did I tend to play them?<br>
                I spent almost all of my time playing these games in my bedroom.
                                
            </p>

            <h3>
                Qualitative Data
            </h3>
            <p>
                Why did I decide to play the games I did?<br>
                In the case of Masters, the times I chose to play that game were almost solely for the game's daily login bonus. The one time I played it for longer than 30 minutes was because I was partaking in a few event missions that took some time.
                <br>
                <br>
                As for Dragalia and FEH, the times I played them during the week were a result of my boredom. I grew bored of sitting at my desk and working on my assignments, so I opted to relax while playing them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Why did I play the 'the game I played the most' the most?<br>
                Out of these three games, FEH has the quickest means of completing the daily login bonus. Alongside that and the fact that I enjoy it, the high opening count and playtime seems more understandable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also a character I really liked got an alternate costume on the 18th, hence the
                2 hour play session.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which game did I enjoy playing the most?<br>
                During that week, I found Fire Emblem Heroes the most enjoyable game to play.
