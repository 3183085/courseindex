                For this assignment, we were tasked with developing daily "code sketches" of a letter of the alphabet using p5.js. My letter of my choice was "V". 
                <br>
                Rather than constructing a single project, our goal was to allot daily time to explore generative art. With our assigned letter as your inspiration, we were to create 7 "code sketches" over the course of 3 weeks, resulting in 21 total.
