                For your first project this semester, you will be tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition inspired by some aspect of your life under COVID19. How has it changed? What have you lost contact with? What have you gained contact with? Think of ways to represent your life under current conditions.
                <br>
                <br>
                The poster must be 24” × 36” digital poster. You will conceive, develop, refine, print, and document the final artefact over the next two weeks.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now here’s the catch: you are not allowed to use any adobe software or other software explicitly designed for print design and production in your process. You are free to use any other digital software against its grain. Some possible avenues to explore: Excel? Word? Screenshots? A video Game? Chat? A Website? Snap Camera? SparkAR? Google Maps? Twitch? The choice is yours. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This poster does not have to be narrative-based. Consider archive, metonymy, synecdoche, and process all as possible avenues to represent your topic.
            </p>
