                For our first project of the semester, we were  tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition inspired by some aspect of our life under COVID19. How has it changed? What have you lost contact with? What have you gained contact with? Questions like those were given to us to better undestand the state in which we're trying to visualize.
                <br>

                However, we were not allowed to use any Adobe software or other software explicitly designed for print design and production. We were free to use any other digital software against its grain. Some possible avenues to explore provided we: Excel, Word, screenshots, a video game, a website, Snapchat, etc. Regardlesso of the choice, the final submission was to be a 24” × 36” digital poster.

                The programs I opted to use were the visual art software Krita and Asperite, a program used to create detailed pixel art.
