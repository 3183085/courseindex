                1) Around the 31:40 mark, the speaker mentions how "things will be marketed in terms of design, in the future." I can relay this sentiment as there have been some instances of an object's creative design outweighing the utility of the item itself. One notable instance being the trend of "hypebeast" apparel that...

            <p>
                My goal with this site right now is to try and add some more visual flair.
                For example, my current goal is to try and overlay the images on the homepage with stripes while also making them grayscale and hoverable. I've got some code from the internet for creating stripe decals in CSS, but stylizing in the manner that I desire is proving to be quite difficult.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the time being, I'm using them as banners for the headers on the homepage. I may keep this layout, while also adding the stripes to the images sometime in the future.
